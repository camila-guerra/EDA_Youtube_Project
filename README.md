### 🎯 Project Objective

I've always been fascinated by what can be discovered through large volumes of data.  
The **YouTube API** offers a goldmine of information ready to explore: trends, audience behavior, video impact... all in real time!

💡 **What's the point of this project?**

I wanted to explore what makes a video trend on YouTube — by looking at real data from different countries 🌎.

The idea isn’t to draw big conclusions, since it’s just a few weeks of data, but to spot initial patterns and practice data cleaning, analysis and visualization skills using Python.

It’s a mix of curiosity + hands-on learning 🧠📊

- 🧑‍💻 Curious people who want to understand what content hits hardest and why

### 🔍 My Personal Motivation

🎨 **I love “Trivia facts”!**

I've always trusted statistics and data. For some reason, my brain gets captivated by patterns and constantly wants to find them.

💡🧠 I enjoy looking for hidden connections and understanding the “why” behind what we see. I'm very curious about people's behavior, as well as how statistics are collected and measured.
