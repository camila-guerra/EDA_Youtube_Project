### 🎯 Project Objective

I've always been fascinated by what can be discovered through large volumes of data.  
The **YouTube API** offers a goldmine of information ready to explore: trends, audience behavior, video impact... all in real time!

💡 **What's the point of this project?**

I wanted to explore what makes a video trend on YouTube — by looking at real data from different countries 🌎.

The idea isn’t to draw big conclusions, since it’s just a few weeks of data, but to spot initial patterns and practice data cleaning, analysis and visualization skills using Python.

It’s a mix of curiosity + hands-on learning 🧠📊

This data is also super useful for:
- 📈 **Companies and brands** wanting to advertise on YouTube  
- 🧠 **Market analysts** interested in consumer behavior patterns  
- 🧑‍💻 Curious people who want to understand what content hits hardest and why

### 🔍 My Personal Motivation

🎨 **I love “Trivia facts”!**

I've always trusted statistics and data. For some reason, my brain gets captivated by patterns and constantly wants to find them.

💡🧠 I enjoy looking for hidden connections and understanding the “why” behind what we see. I'm very curious about people's behavior, as well as how statistics are collected and measured.

### 📈 What exactly did I do?

✅ **Analysis with Python:**  
- I used `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, and `Matplotlib` to analyze trending YouTube videos 📊  
- Worked with data from several countries: 🇦🇷 🇲🇽 🇺🇸 🇨🇦 🇩🇪 🇬🇧 🇮🇳

✅ **Data Cleaning:**  
- Checked and handled null and empty values 🚫  
- Converted columns like `tags` and `publish_time` into proper formats 🔄  
- Filtered out invalid categories and consolidated the dataset 🧹

✅ **Processing and Visualizations:**  
- Mapped categories by `category_id`  
- Grouped by country and category to compare trends 🌍  
- Analyzed key metrics like:  
  - **Views** 👀  
  - **Likes** ❤️  
  - **Comments** 💬  
  - **Duration** ⏱️  
  - **Number of Tags** 🏷️  
  - **Publishing Time** ⏰  

✅ **Key Findings:**  
- Some categories dominate depending on the country 🏆  
- More duration or tags ≠ more views ❌  
- Publishing time varies in impact depending on the region 🕒
